# Kass_active_contour
Python implementation of Kass active contour

Back in 2014, when I started to understand the Active contour, I was not able to use MATLAB due to license issue in my project.

So, I have rewritten the code in Python. I have used Octave for using some functionality of MATLAB.

Libraries required to run this code:
1) Opencv
2) Numpy
3) Scipy
4) Oct2Py (Python library for calling octave functions)
5) Matplotib
